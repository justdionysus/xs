# Moddable SDK - IO Examples

Copyright 2021 Moddable Tech, Inc.<BR>
Revised: November 3, 2021

These examples demonstrate how to use our experimental implementation of Ecma TC53, [ECMAScript Modules for Embedded Systems](https://ecmatc53.github.io/spec/web/spec.html).

It is only implemented for the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers at this time.

For details about the implementation, see the [IO documentation](../../documentation/io/io.md).
